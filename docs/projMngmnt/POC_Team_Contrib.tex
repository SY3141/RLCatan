\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

For the PoC demo, we plan on demonstrating a functional model capable of playing Catan, and beating at
least the benchmark AI players provided in the Catanatron simulator environment.
This will not be an advanced bot, and may not yet implement deep reinforcement learning, but it
will give us key experience in building and testing an AI agent in this environment, and we will be
experimenting with heuristics, which will be key later when we do implement more advanced learning techniques.
The existing environment is of a level of complexity that this is a reasonable goal for the PoC demo.
We also have a meeting scheduled with our supervisor to discuss and refine our demo plans this Wednesday.

Rebecca - The reason for my lower attendance was because of busy weeks with midterms and project deadlines in other courses, so I just reviewed the lecture slides instead.

Some of us commit more frequently than others, but overall work has been fairly evenly
distributed. These numbers may not be up to date at the time you read this, as we expect
commit numbers to drastically increase as PoC work ramps up.

\section{Issue Tracker}

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Jake Read & 0 & 3\\
Sunny Yao & 0 & 0\\
Rebecca Di Filippo & 0 & 1\\
Matthew Cheung & 0 & 0\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We haven't added many of our own issues, but the few closed ones are for peer-reviews.
Since there are only four of us, issue tracking hasn't been a priority, and for most small tasks
we've been listing them out in Discord and assigning them informally.
Moving forward, we'll use the issue tracker more, since tasks will be larger and more complex once
we get deeper into development. Sorry if this makes things hard to track, but there has been a ton
to do across all our courses, and we didn't get around to making a ton of tiny issues for documentation.

\section{CICD}
The Catanatron repo we forked has existing tests and workflows, but they're currently broken.
We've been working on fixing these to get them running again, which would leave us with a
solid pipeline for model development and testing.
We'll also add our own tests for our specific model as we develop it, and add any additional
workflows as needed.

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

\textbf{Trigger Summary:}  
Based on our team charter, the primary triggers for intervention include:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Missing a scheduled meeting without at least 12 hours notice  
\item Repeated missed deadlines with little or no advance communication (more than 1--2 times)  
\item Consistently arriving late without notice  
\item Not contributing adequately or submitting low-quality work  
\item Disruptive behavior or conflict without an attempt to resolve collaboratively  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observed Trigger Events:}  
No formal trigger violations occurred during this period. A few scheduling conflicts were communicated ahead of time and aligned with acceptable reasons outlined in the charter. These included:
\begin{itemize}
\item A member completing work after returning from vacation during reading week
\item A delayed arrival to a meeting due to transportation issues, and the meeting was shifted accordingly
\item During a long (approx 12 hours) SRS polishing work session, a member needed to attend a mandatory tutorial during the meeting and another member had prior family plans in the evening and had to leave early.
\end{itemize}
All instances were communicated prior to the meeting or work session and did not impact project progress.
\medskip{}

\textbf{Plan and Reflection:}  
No corrective action was necessary, as all situations fell under acceptable charter guidelines and were handled responsibly. The team will continue to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Communicate scheduling conflicts in advance
\item Support academic and personal commitments when reasonable
\item Maintain fairness, accountability, and consistent participation
\end{itemize}
Our current triggers appear appropriate and do not require revision at this time.
