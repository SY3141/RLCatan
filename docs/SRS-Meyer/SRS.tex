\section*{(G) Goals}\label{sec:srs-goals}
\renewcommand{\thesubsection}{G.\arabic{subsection}}

\subsection{Context and Overall Objective}\label{subsec:context-and-overall-objective}
The project aims to create an AI agent, named \textbf{RLCatan}, that learns to play the board game \emph{Catan} competitively using deep reinforcement learning. The purpose is to develop a decision-making support tool that aids players by providing strategic advice. This tool will also serve as a powerful AI opponent for practice. The project addresses the challenges of creating an AI for a game with a large state space, stochastic elements like dice rolls, and partially observable information. The final product will be a digital twin that uses computer vision to observe a physical game and provide real-time strategic suggestions.

\subsection{Current Situation}\label{subsec:current-situation}
Despite its popularity, the inherent complexity of \emph{Catan} presents a significant technical challenge for AI development. This complexity limits players' ability to practice against a consistently challenging opponent and prevents a deeper, data-driven understanding of the game's optimal strategies. The lack of a high-level AI bot also restricts training opportunities for competitive players who wish to improve their game. The RLCatan project will address this limitation by creating a tool designed to tackle these specific technical hurdles.

\subsection{Expected Benefits}\label{subsec:expected-benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Enhanced Player Skill and Engagement} – The RLCatan AI provides in-game advice, helping novice players understand the game and allowing advanced players to refine strategies.
    \item {Strategic Insights and Learning} – Offers post-game advice by analyzing key moments and explaining alternative moves to improve understanding and performance.
    \item {AI Innovation and Research Contribution} – The project contributes to AI research by addressing large state spaces, stochastic elements, and partially observable environments, demonstrating the team's technical capabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functionality Overview}\label{subsec:functionality-overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Game state capture} – A camera captures the physical board state.
    \item {Data processing} – Converts captured images into a digital representation of the board and player data.
    \item {AI analysis} – Reinforcement learning model determines optimal actions.
    \item {Output} – Provides move suggestions to the player's device.
    \item {Post-game advice} – Offers insights on key moments after the game concludes.
    \item {Simulation} – AI can simulate gameplay as a competing player.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{High-Level Usage Scenarios}\label{subsec:high-level-usage-scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Scenario 1: In-game advice} – Players show the current board state; the system suggests the optimal next move.
    \item {Scenario 2: Post-game analysis} – Players review performance; the system highlights key moments and alternative strategies.
    \item {Scenario 3: Training against the AI} – Players play a full game against RLCatan, which acts as a competitive opponent for practice.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Exclusions}\label{subsec:limitations-and-exclusions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Physical interaction with the board} – The system will not move pieces or manipulate the board.
    \item {Full real-time tracking} – Focus is on capturing static frames, not continuous video streams.
    \item {Hidden information tracking} – The AI will not access information that is hidden from players.
    \item {Support for expansions} – The scope is limited to standard Settlers of \emph{Catan} rules; expansions are excluded.
\end{itemize}

\setcounter{subsection}{0}

\subsection{Glossary}\label{subsec:glossary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Catan} – A strategy board game called \textit{Settlers of \emph{Catan}} where players collect resources, build roads/settlements, and trade to earn points.
    \item {AI (Artificial Intelligence)} – Field of computer science and engineering that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that usually require the intelligence of a human.
    \item {RL (Reinforcement Learning)} – A type of machine learning where an agent learns how to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.
    \item {Digital twin} – A digital system that mirrors a physical one. In this project, it specifically refers to a digital representation of the physical \emph{Catan} game board, updated in real time.
    \item {CV (Computer Vision)} – An area of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world (in our case, the physical \emph{Catan} board) by extracting meaningful information from digital images and videos.
    \item {LLM (Large Language Model)} – A machine learning model trained on a very large amount of text data to generate and understand natural language.
    \item {Game state} – The current configuration of the game, including player resources, board layout (roads, settlements, cities), and dice rolls.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Components}\label{subsec:components2}
\raggedright The following are a list of elements of the environment that may effect or be affected by the system and the project. It includes other systems to which the system must be interfaced:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Physical \emph{Catan} board and pieces} – The physical game setup that the system observes.
    \item {Players} – Human participants who interact with the physical game and receive decision support.
    \item {Cameras/Sensors} – Hardware that captures the physical board state for the digital twin.
    \item {OpenAI Gym} – Provides a training/testing environment for reinforcement learning agents.
    \item {Reinforcement Learning Agent} – Learns strategies through the simulator and connects with the digital twin for real-time decision support.
    \item {Optional components:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {Smart glasses} – Provide players with an augmented view of the game and recommendations.
        \item {LLM service/API} – Generates natural language explanations of strategies.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}\label{subsec:constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Game rules of \emph{Catan}} – The RL agent must strictly follow the official rules of the game.
    \item {Real-time operation} – The system must process board states and provide recommendations fast enough to be useful during live play.
    \item {Camera limits (Computer Vision)} – Accuracy of game state detection is restricted by available hardware (resolution of camera, field of view, lighting).
    \item {Simulator environment} – The RL agent is limited to the APIs and mechanics provided by the \emph{Catan} simulator.
    \item {Computational resources} – Training and running the RL agent is bounded by available GPU/CPU capacity.
    \item {Timeframe} – The project must be completed within the allocated time frame.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{subsec:assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Players will follow standard \emph{Catan} rules} – The system assumes human players won’t cheat or make illegal moves.
    \item {Stable lighting and camera angle} – The computer vision module assumes it can reliably see the board, even if real-world conditions could vary.
    \item {Network and device reliability} – The system assumes the player’s device and connection work well enough for real-time suggestions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effects}\label{subsec:effects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Player decision support} – The AI provides move suggestions, affecting the decisions players make in real time.
    \item {Learning and adaptation} – The RL agent improves over time, indirectly affecting the level of challenge and advice for players.
    \item {Post-game analysis} – Feedback and suggestions might influence how players approach future games.
    \item {Device usage} – The system uses computational resources on player devices or servers for inference and visualization.
    \item {Game pacing} – Real-time suggestions could speed up or slow down the flow of the game.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Invariants}\label{subsec:invariants}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Board orientation is fixed} – The physical board doesn’t get flipped or moved, so the computer vision module can track it accurately.
    \item {Player order remains constant} – The sequence of turns doesn’t change unexpectedly.
    \item {Player set is fixed} – No new players join, and no existing players leave mid-game.
    \item {Game components stay in place} – Settlements, roads, and resources aren’t physically moved outside of normal game actions.
    \item {Camera/viewing angle remains stable} – The vision system continues to see the board from the expected perspective.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Components}\label{subsec:components}
The system is separated into six major components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Board Representation: The training
    environment for the model, acting as a representation of the game’s state and the
    moves that can be made on a given turn.

    \item Game state digital twin: The component
    in charge of transferring a static/real-time physical board state to the board
    representation, via CV or sensors.

    \item AI model: The pre-trained model,
    responsible for providing a move prompt to be sent to the user.

    \item User Interface: The visual
    representation of the current game state, appended with the move suggested by
    the model, displayed to the user so they can make use of the model’s advice.

    \item Game State Database: A database for
    storing each game state in a given game, for traceability and for providing
    context to an LLM for post-game review.

    \item Communication Layer: The component
    in charge of communication between various components, such as sending the read
    board state to the board representation or transferring the model’s provided
    move to the UI\@.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
\input{../SRS_Reflection.tex}

\subsection*{Jake Read}\label{subsec:jake-read}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I primarily worked on the hazard analysis doc, so for this one I handled a lot of the reviewing.
    I read through each section and made comments on things that could be improved or added, and I think it went quite smoothly.
    My team members are all still pulling their weight, and everyone accepts feedback well, which is great.
    I would say the doc is more coherent now, hopefully that comes across to you as well :)

    \item The main pain point was the good old Meyer template.
    To be honest, I don't enjoy SRS documents, so I wasn't particularly thrilled to have to write another one after 3RA3.
    We were recommended to use Meyer over Volere, and I'm happy with the choice, since Volere is pointlessly long, but Meyer has its own challenges.
    For one, the template is only available in asciidoctor (why?), so I had to rewrite the whole template in LaTeX\@.
    On top of that, it definitely feels like the SRS rubric is focused more so on Volere, so making sure this one followed it too was a bit of a hassle.
    Additionally, last time we used this template, it was the final project for an entire course, but naturally there wasn't as much time for this deliverable, so it feels comparitively limited.
    We compromised my shortening certain sections, while tweaking the template in areas to add more lists of actual requirements.

    \item Quite a lot of our requirements came from chatting with Prof. Istvan David, our supervisor.
    I asked him a lot of questions regarding his expectations when proposing the project, as well as asking for clarification for more technical details we weren't aware of.
    His initial project description was also an excellent source for requirements elicitation since it was well-structured and separated rather modularly.
    Sunny also has connections in the \emph{Catan} competitive community, so we were able to derive some requirements directly from our potential user base.

    \item Most of the courses we've taken throughout uni will help obviously, since that's the fundamental idea behind a capstone project, but there are a few that are particularly relevant.
    3RA3 covered a lot of the documentation that we also have to do for this class.
    Having done similar work before definitely helps reduce some of the frustration of seemingly endless written deliverables (marginally), so I'm grateful for that.
    I'm also currently taking 4AL3 as an elective, which focuses on the application of machine learning.
    It covers reinforcement learning, which is the focus of our project, so it's a very relevant course.
    Overall though, I think the most helpful course for this project, (and in my opinion the most useful course in this degree so far), was 2AA4.
    That course was essentially capstone-lite, with one large main full-term coding project that progressed in stages, from an MVP up to a finished product.
    It also covered design principles and gave critical experience regarding the organization of group coding projects.
    It had a huge workload and was very stressful at the time, but in retrospect it was the most fun I've had in any course, and it's a big part of why I'm so excited for this project.

    \item The main skills we're going to need revolve around deep reinforcement learning and deep neural networks.
    This is the main reason I wanted to take this project in the first place.
    DRL is a relatively new field, with a lot of active research, so an opportunity to work with it to this scale is rare and develops highly marketable software engineering skills.
    With \emph{Catan}, a big area of knowledge we'll need is the creation and application of heuristics to guide the DRL model to improved results.
    I'm rather interested in this, and I'm happy to research it on my own time to try to gain some expertise for the group.

    \item For getting an understanding of DRL and DNN, we have two main ways of gaining the necessary knowledge.
    One of the options for learning this is researching on our own time, using a list of papers on the subject we're slowly collecting on our Discord.
    The other option is discussions with Istvan, since he's an expert on the subject and is happy to help with any confusions we have.
    The approach to learning heuristics to aid the model are similar, research and consulting Istvan, but a bit of trial and error will be involved too.
    By definition, no one knows exactly why heuristics work, they're a matter of intuition, so by just experimenting with different approaches I should be able to learn quite a lot.
    I'm planning on learning primarily by chatting with Istvan.
    I've already been asking him a lot of questions and his answers have been very helpful, so while he's happy to keep helping I'm happy to keep learning from him.
    If I feel like I'm taking too much of his time, I'll fall back on research and experimentation.

\end{enumerate}
