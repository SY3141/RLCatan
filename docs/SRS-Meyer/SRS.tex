\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Goals}
\renewcommand{\thesubsection}{G.\arabic{subsection}}
\renewcommand{\theHsubsection}{G.\arabic{subsection}}
\setcounter{subsection}{0}

\subsection{Context and Overall Objective}\label{subsec:context-and-overall-objective}
The project aims to create an \AI{} agent, named \textbf{RLCatan}, that learns to play the board game \emph{\Catan{}} competitively using deep reinforcement learning. The purpose is to develop a decision-making support tool that aids players by providing strategic advice. This tool will also serve as a powerful \AI{} opponent for practice. The project addresses the challenges of creating an \AI{} for a game with a large state space, stochastic elements like dice rolls, and partially observable information. The final product will be a \DigitalTwin{} that uses computer vision to observe a physical game and provide real-time strategic suggestions.

\subsection{Current Situation}\label{subsec:current-situation}
Despite its popularity, the inherent complexity of \emph{\Catan{}} presents a significant technical challenge for \AI{} development. This complexity limits players' ability to practice against a consistently challenging opponent and prevents a deeper, data-driven understanding of the game's optimal strategies. The lack of a high-level \AI{} bot also restricts training opportunities for competitive players who wish to improve their game. The RLCatan project will address this limitation by creating a tool designed to tackle these specific technical hurdles.

\subsection{Expected Benefits}\label{subsec:expected-benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Enhanced Player Skill and Engagement} – The RLCatan \AI{} provides in-game advice, helping novice players understand the game and allowing advanced players to refine strategies.

\subsection{User Profiles}\label{subsec:User Profiles}
To ensure the system addresses the needs of its target audience, we have identified three distinct user profiles within the "Players of \emph{\Catan{}}" stakeholder group.

\hspace{1cm}

\noindent\textbf{1. The Novice Player}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Game Knowledge:} Limited understanding of strategic depth; often focuses on basic rules and immediate resource needs.
    \item \textbf{Goals:} To learn the fundamentals, understand optimal building placements, and avoid common mistakes.
    \item \textbf{Digital Literacy:} Varies, but expects a simple, intuitive, and highly guided interface.
    \item \textbf{Rationale:} The system's in-game advice functionality and clear user interface are primarily tailored for this user. The \AI{} provides straightforward recommendations, helping them make informed decisions and build a foundational understanding of the game without feeling overwhelmed.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{2. The Intermediate Player}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Game Knowledge:} Has a solid grasp of the rules and common strategies but struggles with adapting to complex game states or high-level opponent plays.
    \item \textbf{Goals:} To improve their win rate, discover new strategies, and understand the trade-offs of different moves.
    \item \textbf{Digital Literacy:} Generally comfortable with technology and can navigate more detailed features.
    \item \textbf{Rationale:} This user benefits most from the system's post-game analysis, which will highlight key strategic moments and explain why alternative moves would have been better. This provides the deeper, data-driven insights needed to advance their skills beyond a basic level.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{3. The Competitive Player}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Game Knowledge:} Extensive knowledge of the game, including advanced strategies, common openings, and opponent metagame.
    \item \textbf{Goals:} To find the absolute optimal play in any given situation, test new theories, and practice against a highly challenging opponent.
    \item \textbf{Digital Literacy:} High; they are willing to engage with complex data visualizations and advanced settings.
    \item \textbf{Rationale:} The \AI{} model's ability to serve as a competitive opponent is crucial for this user profile.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Game runs to completion with all moves recorded.
    \item Agent responds to human actions appropriately.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Postconditions (Failure Guarantees):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If crash occurs, session ends with error logs.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Human starts a new game session.
    \item Game environment is initialized.
    \item Player and \RL{} agent alternate turns.
    \item Agent observes player actions and adapts accordingly.
    \item Game concludes, and results are displayed.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Justification:}

Testing the agent against human input ensures it handles unpredictable behaviors and can offer a meaningful challenge. This scenario is also key for validating real-world deployment feasibility.

\subsection{Verification and Acceptance Criteria}\label{subsec:verification-and-acceptance-criteria}

\noindent\textbf{Validation Overview:}

To validate compatibility, simulation interoperability testing will be performed. The \RL{} agent will be tested in multiple versions of the environment. The validation of the functional requirements outlined for the RLCatan agent will be conducted throughout the development lifecycle, with a strong focus on acceptance testing and simulation-based evaluation.

Early validation efforts will involve the use of simplified \emph{\Catan{}} game environments and prototypes of the \RL{} agent's architecture. Key stakeholders, such as \AI{} researchers, game designers, and domain experts, will participate in these early-stage reviews.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{Unit Testing:}

Unit testing will be employed to verify the correctness of individual components, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item State representation
    \item Reward computation
    \item Policy/action selection mechanisms
\end{itemize}

By isolating and testing these components, the development team can catch logical and algorithmic errors early, ensuring reliable behavior in the broader simulation environment.

\noindent\textbf{Validation of Non-Functional Requirements:}

\noindent\textbf{Cross-Platform Environment Compatibility:}

The agent will be tested in different \emph{\Catan{}} environments (e.g., Python implementations, or standardized OpenAI Gym-style interfaces) to ensure stable and consistent behavior across frameworks.

\noindent\textbf{Real-Time Decision Making:}

To validate real-time decision-making capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Latency profiling and timing tests will be conducted.
    \item Verifying that the agent makes decisions within predefined time limits during gameplay, particularly in competitive or interactive scenarios.
    \item Continuous integration (CI) pipelines will ensure model updates or algorithm changes do not degrade response time.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Strategic Planning and Reward Optimization:}

To ensure the \RL{} agent optimizes for long-term goals (e.g., winning the game rather than maximizing short-term resource gain):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Longitudinal performance testing will be conducted.
    \item Thousands of game simulations will be run to track:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Policy convergence
        \item Learning curves
        \item Win rates across different strategies and game configurations
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Data Privacy and Ethical Compliance:}

Although the \RL{} agent may not handle personal data directly:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ethical compliance testing will ensure training data (e.g., human gameplay data) respects privacy guidelines.
    \item No identifiable user data will be stored or processed without consent.
    \item Data source validation and usage audits will ensure compliance with academic and industry standards.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{State and Action Accuracy:}

To validate the agent’s perception and behavior:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sanity tests and assertion-based checks will be implemented.
    \item Ensure the agent:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Acts according to official game rules
        \item Respects legal action constraints
        \item Maintains valid internal state representations
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Scalability and Training Stability:}

To test the system’s ability to handle increased complexity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Performance testing such as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Load testing
        \item Stress testing
        \item Distributed training simulations
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ensure the training pipeline can support large-scale experiments without crashing.
    \item Validate that the agent remains stable under diverse training scenarios.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formalizations}
\subsubsection{Formalization of the Learning Objective}
\label{sec:formalization}

The \RL{} agent is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by the tuple:
\[
(S, A, P, R, \gamma)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ is the set of all possible game states (e.g., the current board configuration, player hands, road/settlement locations, etc.)
    \item $A$ is the set of actions available to the agent (e.g., build, trade, play development cards, etc.)
    \item $P(s' \mid s, a)$ is the transition probability between states
    \item $R(s, a)$ is the scalar reward obtained after performing action $a$ in state $s$
    \item $\gamma \in [0, 1]$ is the discount factor applied to future rewards
\end{itemize}

The agent seeks a policy $\pi(a \mid s)$ that maximizes the expected discounted return:
\[
\pi^* = \arg\max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t)\right]
\]

In the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) formulation used by this project, the policy $\pi(a \mid s)$ or the action-value function $Q(s, a)$ is represented by a deep neural network parameterized by weights $\theta$. The objective is then to learn $\theta$ that minimizes the temporal-difference loss:
\[
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s, a, r, s')} \left[ \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\theta^-}(s', a') - Q_{\theta}(s, a) \right)^2 \right]
\]
where $Q_{\theta^-}$ denotes a target network with fixed parameters for stability during training.

The input $s$ to the neural network encodes the current game state (board configuration, available resources, and player status), and the output $Q_{\theta}(s, a)$ estimates the expected long-term reward for each possible action.

\subsubsection{Z-Notation Formalization of Game Rules}
\label{sec:math-formalization}

This section provides a partial formalization of the rules and conditions of \textit{Settlers of Catan} using \textbf{Z notation}.
The purpose is to precisely define the relationships between the game state variables, actions, and constraints used by the reinforcement learning agent. \newline

\textbf{Basic Types and Sets}

We define the primitive types representing fundamental game elements:

\[
[PLAYER, RESOURCE, TILE, NODE, EDGE]
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{PLAYER} represents each player in the game.
    \item \texttt{RESOURCE} $\in \{\text{Brick}, \text{Lumber}, \text{Wool}, \text{Grain}, \text{Ore}\}$.
    \item \texttt{TILE}, \texttt{NODE}, and \texttt{EDGE} correspond to the spatial elements of the board. \newline
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Board Schema}

\begin{schema}{Board}
    tiles: \mathcal{P} TILE \\
    nodes: \mathcal{P} NODE \\
    edges: \mathcal{P} EDGE \\
    tileNodes: TILE \fun \mathcal{P} NODE \\  % Each tile touches some nodes
    tileEdges: TILE \fun \mathcal{P} EDGE \\  % Each tile touches some edges
    nodeTiles: NODE \fun \mathcal{P} TILE    % Each node is adjacent to some tiles
\where
    \forall t: TILE @
        \#(tileNodes(t)) = 6 \land
        \#(tileEdges(t)) = 6
\end{schema}

This schema describes the board, and the relationships between tiles and their edges/nodes. \newline

\textbf{Game State Schema}

\begin{schema}{GameState}
    players: \mathcal{P} PLAYER \\
    resources: PLAYER \fun RESOURCE \pfun \mathbb{N} \\
    roads: PLAYER \fun \mathcal{P} EDGE \\
    settlements: PLAYER \fun \mathcal{P} NODE \\
    turn: PLAYER \\
    diceRoll: \mathbb{N}
    \where
    turn \in players \\
    diceRoll \in 2 \dots 12
\end{schema}


This schema describes the static and dynamic components of a single game state.
The \texttt{turn} variable indicates which player's move is currently being processed. \newline

\textbf{Turn Transition Rule}

\begin{schema}{NextTurn}
    \Delta GameState \\
    nextPlayer?: PLAYER
    \where
    nextPlayer? \in players \\
    turn' = nextPlayer?
\end{schema}


This transition schema expresses that the game moves from one valid state to another by assigning the next player's turn. \newline

\textbf{Resource Distribution Rule}

\begin{schema}{DistributeResources}
    \Delta GameState \\
    rolledNumber?: \mathbb{N}
    \where
    rolledNumber? = diceRoll \\
    \forall p: PLAYER @ resources'(p) = resources(p) + f(p, rolledNumber?)
\end{schema}


Where $f(p, rolledNumber?)$ represents the function mapping dice results to resource gains for player $p$, based on their settlements' positions. \newline

\textbf{Valid Action Schema}

\begin{schema}{ValidAction}
    GameState \\
    action?: ACTION \\
    isValid!: \mathbb{B}
    \where
    (action? = \text{BuildRoad} \implies \text{canAffordRoad(turn)}) \\
    (action? = \text{BuildSettlement} \implies \text{canAffordSettlement(turn)}) \\
    (action? = \text{Trade} \implies \text{tradeValid(turn)}) \\
    isValid! = (action? \in \text{LegalActions(turn)})
\end{schema}


This schema defines the logical constraints under which an action is considered legal in the game state.
Each predicate ensures the acting player has sufficient resources and that the move complies with board and rule constraints.

\subsection*{Jake Read}\label{subsec:jake-read}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I primarily worked on the hazard analysis doc, so for this one I handled a lot of the reviewing.
    I read through each section and made comments on things that could be improved or added, and I think it went quite smoothly.
    My team members are all still pulling their weight, and everyone accepts feedback well, which is great.
    I would say the doc is more coherent now, hopefully that comes across to you as well :)

    \item The main pain point was the good old Meyer template.
    To be honest, I don't enjoy SRS documents, so I wasn't particularly thrilled to have to write another one after 3RA3.
    We were recommended to use Meyer over Volere, and I'm happy with the choice, since Volere is pointlessly long, but Meyer has its own challenges.
    For one, the template is only available in asciidoctor (why?), so I had to rewrite the whole template in LaTeX\@.
    On top of that, it definitely feels like the SRS rubric is focused more so on Volere, so making sure this one followed it too was a bit of a hassle.
    Additionally, last time we used this template, it was the final project for an entire course, but naturally there wasn't as much time for this deliverable, so it feels comparitively limited.
    We compromised my shortening certain sections, while tweaking the template in areas to add more lists of actual requirements.

    \item Quite a lot of our requirements came from chatting with Prof. Istvan David, our supervisor.
    I asked him a lot of questions regarding his expectations when proposing the project, as well as asking for clarification for more technical details we weren't aware of.
    His initial project description was also an excellent source for requirements elicitation since it was well-structured and separated rather modularly.
    Sunny also has connections in the \emph{\Catan{}} competitive community, so we were able to derive some requirements directly from our potential user base.

    \item Most of the courses we've taken throughout uni will help obviously, since that's the fundamental idea behind a capstone project, but there are a few that are particularly relevant.
    3RA3 covered a lot of the documentation that we also have to do for this class.
    Having done similar work before definitely helps reduce some of the frustration of seemingly endless written deliverables (marginally), so I'm grateful for that.
    I'm also currently taking 4AL3 as an elective, which focuses on the application of machine learning.
    It covers reinforcement learning, which is the focus of our project, so it's a very relevant course.
    Overall though, I think the most helpful course for this project, (and in my opinion the most useful course in this degree so far), was 2AA4.
    That course was essentially capstone-lite, with one large main full-term coding project that progressed in stages, from an MVP up to a finished product.
    It also covered design principles and gave critical experience regarding the organization of group coding projects.
    It had a huge workload and was very stressful at the time, but in retrospect it was the most fun I've had in any course, and it's a big part of why I'm so excited for this project.

    \item The main skills we're going to need revolve around deep reinforcement learning and deep neural networks.
    This is the main reason I wanted to take this project in the first place.
    DRL is a relatively new field, with a lot of active research, so an opportunity to work with it to this scale is rare and develops highly marketable software engineering skills.
    With \emph{\Catan{}}, a big area of knowledge we'll need is the creation and application of heuristics to guide the DRL model to improved results.
    I'm rather interested in this, and I'm happy to research it on my own time to try to gain some expertise for the group.

    \item For getting an understanding of DRL and DNN, we have two main ways of gaining the necessary knowledge.
    One of the options for learning this is researching on our own time, using a list of papers on the subject we're slowly collecting on our Discord.
    The other option is discussions with Istvan, since he's an expert on the subject and is happy to help with any confusions we have.
    The approach to learning heuristics to aid the model are similar, research and consulting Istvan, but a bit of trial and error will be involved too.
    By definition, no one knows exactly why heuristics work, they're a matter of intuition, so by just experimenting with different approaches I should be able to learn quite a lot.
    I'm planning on learning primarily by chatting with Istvan.
    I've already been asking him a lot of questions and his answers have been very helpful, so while he's happy to keep helping I'm happy to keep learning from him.
    If I feel like I'm taking too much of his time, I'll fall back on research and experimentation.

\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Sunny Yao}\label{subsec:sunny-yao}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    This deliverable used the Meyer template which we have experience with from
    our requirements courses. This gave us extensive experience in writing
    requirements documents, and we were able to leverage this experience to
    efficiently produce a high-quality document. However, we had to adapt the
    template to fit the specific needs of our project, effectively shortening
    section

    \item Some of the pain points included syncing requirements and components
    across all of the sections. We had to ensure that the components we
    defined in the environment section were consistent with those in the system
    section, and that the requirements we defined were feasible given the
    components we had. This required a lot of back-and-forth and revisions to
    ensure consistency.

    \item It was useful to get the perspectives of users as well as researching the 
    top currently existing competitive \emph{\Catan{}} bots. We were able to look at the limitations
    of these bots and their user interfaces to help us define requirements for our own project.
    In addition, we were able to get a better understanding of the needs of reinforcement
    learning systems from our supervisor, who has extensive experience in this area.

    \item We have taken 3RA3, which focused on requirements engineering and software design.
    This course provided us with a strong foundation in writing requirements documents
    and designing software systems. In addition the engineering fundamentals courses since
    1P13 have provided us with a strong foundation in software engineering principles and practices.
    We have also taken courses in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which will be useful
    for understanding the reinforcement learning aspects of our project.

    \item The skills we will need to successfully complete this project include reinforcement
    learning, computer vision, as well as competitive \emph{\Catan{}} strategies. We will also need
    strong software engineering skills to design and implement the system. In addition, we will
    need to be able to work effectively as a team, communicating and collaborating to ensure
    that we are all on the same page and working towards the same goals.

    \item The main way we will gain the necessary reinforcement learning and computer vision
    knowledge is through research and self-study. We will read papers and articles on these topics,
    as well as experimenting with different techniques and approaches. Also, many of us are taking
    the 4AL3 course this term, which focuses on machine learning and will provide us with a strong
    foundation in this area. For competitive \emph{\Catan{}} strategies, we will leverage the expertise of
    competitive players as well as our own experience playing the game. We will also study existing \emph{\Catan{}} bots
    to understand their strategies and approaches.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Rebecca}\label{subsec:rebecca}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item During this deliverable our team divided the work evenly and met weekly to stay 
    organized. We assigned and tracked tasks through Discord, which 
    helped keep everyone accountable. After completing our assigned
     sections, we reviewed the rubric to make sure each requirement
      was met. On the final day before submission, we held a seven-hour
      work session to review every part of the document together and
       ensure full consistency and quality.

    \item One of the main pain points during this deliverable was that the rubric included
    several elements not explicitly covered by the Meyer template.
     Because of this, we had to diverge from the original format to 
     align with the rubric’s expectations. We decided to create
      a “Changes Table” that clearly outlined all modifications and
       additions we made to the original template, ensuring clarity
        and consistency across the document.

    \item We spoke extensively with our supervisor, Dr. David,
     who proposed the project and provided valuable insights into 
     reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL).
      In addition, Sunny has a connection with a competitive 
      \emph{\Catan{}} player, whose input has been great in
     shaping some of our project requirements and understanding 
       player strategies.

    \item I am currently taking 4AL3 (Introduction to Machine Learning),
     which aligns closely with our project since it covers many of the
      core topics in DRL. Previous courses such as 3RA3 (Requirements Engineering)
       were also extremely helpful, as we used the Meyer template
        originally introduced there. Also, 2AA4 (Software Design I)
         was valuable because it emphasized iterative project development, starting
          with an MVP and building up, which mirrors the structure of our capstone project.

    \item Our team needs to develop strong knowledge in deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
     and neural networks, as these are the core of our system. This is a fast-growing field
      with many new research directions. From the sounds of it, Jake and I will focus on researching DRL models 
      and architectures, Sunny will focus on the digital twin,
      and personas modelling. Finally Matthew will concentrate on integrating computer vision (CV) into the project.

    \item For DRL, Jake and I's main learning methods will include independent
     research using online resources, papers, and tutorials. Also regular discussions
      with Dr. David for technical guidance. Dr. David has provided us with lots of relevant papers
      and resources to get us started which is extremely helpful. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Matthew Cheung}\label{subsec:matthew-cheung}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Our team worked well together, dividing the workload evenly and holding weekly meetings to stay organized.
    We used a Kanban board on GitHub and a Discord server for communication, which helped us track progress and maintain accountability.
    On the day of submission, we held a seven-hour work session to ensure the document was consistent and high-quality.
    The group synergy as a team was great as we helped each other when necessary, allowing for a collaborative work process.

    \item The main pain point was adapting the Meyer template to fit the rubric's requirements.
    The template itself was in an unfamiliar format (asciidoctor), requiring us to rewrite it in LaTeX.
    Also, we found the rubric seemed better suited for the Volere template, so we had to modify our Meyer document to include more explicit requirement lists.
    We created a "Changes from Template" table to clearly explain all our modifications, ensuring the document remained coherent and aligned with the rubric.
    We also had to consistently sync requirements and components across different sections to prevent inconsistencies, which involved a lot of back-and-forth and revisions.
    This led to a lot of unplanned work, significantly increasing the time we had to spend working on this document.
    In hindsight, we should have read the rubric thoroughly at the start, which would have shown us that it was modeled after Volere, not Meyer.

    \item A significant number of our requirements were gathered from external sources.
    Our main source was our project supervisor, Dr. Istvan David, who provided the initial project description and answered our technical questions.
    Additionally, a team member has a connection to a competitive \emph{\Catan{}} player, which allowed us to get direct user input.
    This helped us understand the specific needs of our target audience and the limitations of existing competitive \AI{} bots, which in turn helped shape our requirements.

    \item Several courses have been, and will be, crucial for our project's success.
    3RA3 (Requirements Engineering): This course gave us a solid foundation in writing requirements documents and using the Meyer template.
    4AL3 (Introduction to Machine Learning): This elective course is directly relevant to our project's core, as it covers topics like reinforcement learning (RL) and deep neural networks (DNNs).
    2AA4 (Software Design I): This course provided invaluable experience in managing a large, full-term group coding project, emphasizing iterative development and organization.

    \item To successfully complete this capstone project, our team will need to acquire several key knowledge and skill sets.
    We'll need expertise in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) andneural networks, which are at the core of our system.
    A significant area of focus will be understanding how to apply heuristics to guide the DRL model for optimal performance.
    Additionally, we'll need to develop a deep understanding of the digital twin concept to accurately model the physical game board.
    Finally, mastering computer vision (CV) will be crucial for processing visual input from a camera to represent the game state digitally.

    \item For DRL and DNN's: Independent research using academic papers, online resources, and tutorials.
    We could also have regular discussions with our supervisor, Dr. Istvan David, who is an expert in the field, as his feedback has already been very helpful.
    For Digital Twin and Persona Modeling: Self-study and research into digital twin architectures and human-computer interaction principles, in pair with experimenting with design patterns and models to see what works best for our system.
