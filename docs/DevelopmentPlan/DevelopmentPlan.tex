\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\raggedright
Our team regularly meets 4:30-6:30pm every Thursday.
We will schedule additional meetings every time we have an addressable 
agenda. Virtual meetings will be held through a Discord call 
and physical meetings will be held at tutorial locations or ETB.
 Meetings may be hybrid depending on schedules. We will schedule
  meetings with our advisor when we require resources or 
  expertise. Meetings will be structured with a set agenda devised by the notetaker
  before scheduling to address all of the topics we need to discuss.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\raggedright
We will be using Discord as our main communication 
platform. We will create a server with channels for general 
discussion, meeting scheduling, and project management.
For more formal communication, we will use email to contact 
our advisor.
We will also use GitHub Issues for tracking existing 
issues and their closures.


\section{Team Member Roles}

\raggedright
\begin{itemize}
  \item Team Leader: this person is responsible for scheduling meetings,
    ensuring deadlines are met, and overall team coordination. This person will
    also be the main point of contact with the supervisor and the TA.
  \item Notetaker: this person is responsible for creating meeting agendas and also
    taking notes during meetings. This person will also be updating the Kanban
    board.
  \item IT: this person is responisble for managing the GitHub repository, including
    branches, pull requests, and issues. This person will also be resonsible for trouble
    shooting any technical issues that arise.
  \item Researcher: this person is responsible for researching any topics that
    the team is unfamiliar with. This person will also be responsible for finding
    relevant papers and articles to help the team understand the project better.
\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\raggedright
We will be using GitHub for version control and collaboration.
To manage development, we will create branches for each task on the Kanban Board,
along with sub-branches for individual team members work. Pull requests 
will be used to review and merge code changes, ensuring quality and 
consistency. GitHub Issues will be used to track tasks and bugs, with 
issues assigned to specific team members or whoever is available.
To streamline this process, we will also use issue templates for 
consistency in reporting and classification of issues. 

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

%\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
%details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
%for deadlines.}

\raggedright
We will be using GitHub Projects to manage our project tasks and milestones. We
will create a project board with columns for "To Do", "In Progress", "In Review
", and "Done". Each task will be represented as a card on the board. These tasks
will be prioritized based on their importance and deadlines. Every deadline will
directly correspond to deadlines from the course outline.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

\raggedright
The main risks for the success of our project are the AI not 
being able to effectively learn to play Catan at a high level, 
and the user interface not being intuitive or user-friendly. 
To mitigate these risks, we will conduct regular Elo testing
against existing benchmark opponents to make sure the AI is 
improving or at least not regressing. We will also conduct user 
testing sessions to  gather feedback and make iterative improvements to the interface. 
Lastly we will ensure that our AI models are thoroughly tested and 
validated before deployment. When we demonstrate our proof of concept,
we will showcase that the AI is able to win a game of Catan, even if
it is not performing at a high level at this stage.

\section{Expected Technology}

\raggedright
We expect to use Python as our primary programming 
language, as well as using the Catanatron open source 
libary for simulating Catan games and training our models.
We will also utilize React and JavaScript as 
our web framework for building the user interface and 
digital twin. For computer vision models, we will be using
openCV and yolov9 for image recognition and processing. We
will not be using CI/CD, since our project doesnt require 100\% uptime.


\section{Coding Standard}

Since our projects backend is primarily in Python, we will be following the PEP 8 Coding
Standard. The link to this standard can be found
\href{https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/}{here}.

\medskip

Our frontend is primarily in JavaScript and React, so we will be following the google style guide
coding standard. The link to this standard can be found \href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html}{here}.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}


\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Rebecca Di Filippo:}\label{subsec:rebecca-difilippo-reflection}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Creating a development plan before starting a project helps the team organize the scope,
   timeline, and responsibilities. It acts as a roadmap so we don’t waste time
    moving in the wrong direction. The developmet plan also makes sure everyone is on the same page 
    about attendance, meetings, roles and responsibilities. Without a plan, there is possibility of miscommunication,
    disorganization, and going in the wrong direction.
  \item The biggest advantage of CI is that it automatically runs tests when you make a commit
   or open a pull request. That way, you know right when you commit if the code is safe to merge, which helps 
   avoid integration problems and conflicts. CD makes deploying new versions faster and more reliable,
    which saves time and helps avoid mistakes. The downside to CI/CD is that it can take some effort,
    and it’s annoying when builds are slow.
  \item Our group didn’t have major disagreements. The closest thing to a disagreement was, at first we
  thought CI/CD would be too difficult and unnecessary for the project. However, after discussing it
  with Dr. Istvan David, we concluded that it is worth including given the scope of our project. Its also
  a good learning experience.

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}


\subsection*{External Goals}

%\wss{What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the
%goals related to the functionality or quality of the project.  These are the
%goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.  Potential goals are
%to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
%interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\raggedright
Our teams external goals for this project are to attain a strong understanding
of reinforcement learning and computer vision, to be able to build a hireable portfolio. 
We also are aiming to get a A/A+ in the course, since we plan to put a lot of effort into the
project.

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

%\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on
%time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?}

\raggedright
Our team meets every week at 4:30-6:30 pm on Thursday. All other meetings are 
scheduled on a weekly basis, depending on deadlines and amount of work. It is expected that all
team members attend every meeting and arrive on time. If a team member is unable
to attend a meeting they must notify the team at least 12 hours in advance (withholding an emergency situation). If a 
team member is going to be late or must leave early they must notify the team prior
to the meeting. 

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

%\wss{What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?
%What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?}

\raggedright
An acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or deadline includes sickness, family
emergencies, or academic obligations. On the other hand, unacceptable excuses include
forgetting, being lazy, or not prioritizing the team. Again, it is expected that the team
knows 12 hours in advance if a member is going to miss a meeting or deadline. This time
frame allows the team to adjust their plans accordingly.

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

%\wss{What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot
%attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team
%deliverable?}

\raggedright
In case of an emergency, the team member must notify the team as soon as possible, before
the meeting or deadline. If a deadline cannot be met, other members will distribute 
the work among themselves to ensure the deadline is met. Its important to note that 
1-2 missed deadline with little notice is acceptable, but repeated offenses will not 
be tolerated.

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

%\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding the quality
%of team members' preparation for team meetings and the quality of the
%deliverables that members bring to the team?}

\raggedright
It is expected that all team members come to meetings prepared with the assigned
task completed for each week. It is expected that all tasks we complete are of high quality
and have been reviewed by at least one other team member before submission. Each
deliverable will be reviewed by all team members before submission to ensure quality 
and consistency. Lastly, all coding should follow the agreed upon coding standards.


\subsubsection*{Attitude}

%\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas,
%interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding
%team member contributions?  Do you want to introduce a code of conduct?  Do you
%want a conflict resolution plan?  Can adopt existing codes of conduct.}

\raggedright
The team leader is responsible for ensuring that all team members are treated fairly.
All team members need to be open to new ideas and willing to compromise. If conflicts
arise, the team will discuss the issue and come to a resolution that works for everyone.
If a team member is not contributing to the team, the team leader will address the issue
with the member privately. If the issue persists, the team will discuss the issue with
the TA or instructor.

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

Our team will stay on track by setting clear weekly goals, 
using github Kanban boards to monitor progress, and 
holding regular check-ins to ensure accountability. Tasks 
will be distributed fairly according to skills and proficiencies, 
and progress will be tracked through version control commits and 
documented updates. Members who perform well will be recognized 
for their contributions and can take greater lead on project
direction in future tasks. If a member's performance 
falls below expectations, we will first address the issue 
through direct communication and support, ensuring that 
individual effort is accurately reflected in evaluations.
We expect to have high attendance from all members with prior 
warning for any absences.

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

%\wss{How will you build team cohesion (fun time, group rituals, etc.)? }

\raggedright
Considering our team will be working together for 8 months, its important to build
team cohesion. We will do this by scheduling fun activities outside of meetings. one
of those fun activities will be a team dinner at the end of the project to celebrate.
We also plan to play \textit{Catan} together outside of meetings. 

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 

%\wss{How will you make decisions in your group? Consensus?  Vote? How will you
%handle disagreements? }

\raggedright
Our team will converse together before making any major decisions. We will try to reach
a consensus, but if we are unable to do so we will vote through discord polls. In the event
there is a disagreement , the team leader will have the final say.
