\section{Introduction}

\raggedright{
    A hazard is defined as a property or condition in the system together
    with a condition in the environment that has the potential to cause harm or
    damage. We define harm as the underperformance of our system in Catan
    that leads to the incorrect instruction of players. In addition, we consider
    disruption of play, loss of game data/state as harm.
}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
\raggedright{
    The loss that can be incurred because of the hazards defined above include the
    forfeiture or inability to continue a game of Catan. This can affect the 
    user experience of our software and lead to a loss of trust in the product.

}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

Components: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The board representation
\item The game state digital twin
\item The AI model
\item User Interface
\item Game State Database
\end{itemize}


\section{Critical Assumptions}

\raggedright{
We assume that the users of our system will be familiar with the rules of Catan and
know how to play the game. We also assume that the users will have a basic understanding
of how to interact with a digital interface. We also assume that existing consumer
hardware will be able to run full depth processing of our AI model.

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
