## About our project

The project involves creating an AI-enabled digital twin for real-time decision support in the board game Settlers of Catan. Students will develop a reinforcement learning agent that can learn to play the game through a simulator or API, providing both in-game advice and post-game analysis. The digital twin will observe a physical tabletop game using sensors or cameras, process the game state with computer vision, and provide recommendations to players in real time. The project also includes visualizing the game state, and optionally incorporating human trade behavior modeling through personas, smart glasses for alternative viewpoints, and large language models to explain alternative strategies.
