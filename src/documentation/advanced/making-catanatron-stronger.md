### Making Catanatron Bot Stronger

The best bot right now is Alpha Beta Search with a hand-crafted value function. One of the most promising ways of improving Catanatron is to have your custom player inhert from ([`AlphaBetaPlayer`](../../catanatron/catanatron/players/minimax.py)) and set a better set of weights for the value function. You can also edit the value function and come up with your own innovative features!

For more sophisticated approaches, see example player implementations in [catanatron/catanatron/players](../../catanatron/catanatron/players)
